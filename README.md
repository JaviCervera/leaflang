# ![pico](logo.png) The Pico programming language

A super simple interpreted language inspired by BASIC. It transpiles to Lua, and comes with a custom interpreter that, in the future, will be able to load modules from dynamic libraries.

The language is imperative and supports classic procedural programming. It has no structs, but tables can be used to group data instead. I have also developed a separate functional language called [Step](https://github.com/JaviCervera/step).
